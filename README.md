# Diff1cult

A specialized diff tool for analyzing changes in Unity/C# game mods that use Harmony patches. Diff1cult helps mod developers understand how their patched methods have changed between game versions.

## Features

- üîç Automatically detects Harmony patches in your mod's source code
- üéØ Identifies the exact methods being patched
- üìä Generates an interactive HTML report showing:
  - Side-by-side diff view of changed methods
  - Original (old) source code
  - New source code
  - Your patch code
- üé® Smart inline diffing that highlights specific value changes
- üì± Responsive layout
- üìù Detailed logging with show/hide functionality

## Usage

```powershell
dotnet run --project Diff1cult.csproj <mod source folder> <old src folder> <new src folder> [--verbose] [--test]
```
or
```powershell
Diff1cult.exe <mod source folder> <old src folder> <new src folder> [--verbose] [--test]
```
### Parameters

- `mod source folder`: Path to your mod's source code containing Harmony patches
- `old src folder`: Path to the old version of the game's source code
- `new src folder`: Path to the new version of the game's source code
- `--verbose`: Enable detailed debug output
- `--test`: Include a test diff example in the output

### Example

```powershell
dotnet run --project Diff1cult.csproj "C:\mods\MyMod\src" "C:\game\v1.0\src" "C:\game\v1.1\src"
```
or
```powershell
Diff1cult.exe "C:\code\MyMod\src" "C:\gameSrc\v1.0\src" "C:\gameSrc\v1.1\src"
```

## Output

The tool generates a `diff_report.html` file containing:
- A summary of found patches and changes
- Interactive list of changed methods
- Side-by-side diff view with:
  - Line numbers for both versions
  - Syntax highlighting
  - Inline change highlighting
  - Resizable panes
- Original and new source code views
- Patch code view
- Detailed execution log (collapsible)
